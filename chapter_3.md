## 3.1 Some Basics
In most companies, marketing, sales and process control are major drivers for promoting data quality and producing comparable numbers and facts about the business. But, even production and Resarch and Development (R&D) departments need reliable data sources to use statistical methods or data mining to improve output and profitability. In most companies, the main pmpetus for checking and restructuring the data and processes is the introduction of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). CRM inbues the company's own data with new meaning. Gone are the days when customer data management only meant using the correct address in the mailing list. Today's data management must target individual customers and provide more communication and better quality information tailored to theses specific customers and their customer behavior. Data management forms the basis for using intelligent methods such as data mining to analyse the wealth of knowledge available in a company and build an optimal communication with customers and stakeholders.

In many companies, there is hardly any distinction between the terms knowledge, information, and data.
